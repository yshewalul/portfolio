- project: Fire Testing of Resilient and Sustainable Building Materials 
  role: SFPE Foundation Research Grant
  duration: 2023 &mdash; Present
  url: "https://www.sfpe.org/foundation/foundationresearch/foundationresearch-ongoing"
  description: The project's objectives are to identify the sustainable building materials used in construction, 
                the fire testing methods used for those materials, and potential fire risks that are not addressed in existing testing methods with further experimental fire testing. I am working as Co-PI with Prof R. Walls, Dr N. F. Quiroz.
