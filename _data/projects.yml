- project: Fire Testing of Resilient and Sustainable Building Materials 
  funder: SFPE Foundation Research Grant
  duration: 2023 &mdash; Present
  url: "https://www.sfpe.org/foundation/foundationresearch/foundationresearch-ongoing"
  description: The project's objectives are to identify the sustainable building materials used in construction, 
                the fire testing methods used for those materials, and potential fire risks that are not addressed in existing testing methods with further experimental fire testing. I am working as Co-PI with Prof R. Walls, Dr N. F. Quiroz.

- project: Fire Behavior of Construction Systems Incorporating Waste Materials
  funder: SFPE Foundation Student Research Grant
  duration: 2021 &mdash; Present
  url: "https://www.sfpe.org/foundation/foundationresearch/appgrants"
  description: The project aim is to identify commonly used waste materials in construction systems for which fire ratings have not been obtained and conduct experimental fire testing on 
              construction systems incorporating such waste materials. The results of this study hold the potential to inform strategies of 
            the fire service when responding to incidents where large quantities of oil-based recycled materials are encapsulated in building elements.

- project: Investigating Mechanical Properties of Concrete Using Different Sources of Water for Mixing and Curing
  funder: The Institution of Structural Engineers MSc Research Grant
  duration: 2021 &mdash; 2022
  url: "https://www.istructe.org/resources/report/experimental-investigation-of-mechanical-propertie/"
  description: The primary aim of the project is to find a potential replacement for potable water for concrete production taking in to consideration the fact that the item is scarce.


- project: Sustainable Integration of Waste Steel Scrap as Reinforcing Material on the Mechanical Properties of Concrete
  funder: Research and Publication Director of Jimma University Grant
  duration: 2020 &mdash; 2021
 # url: "https://www.istructe.org/resources/report/experimental-investigation-of-mechanical-propertie/"
  description: The primary aim of the project is to incorporate waste steel scrap as a sustainable reinforcing material in concrete and to enhace its mechanical properties.
